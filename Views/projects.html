        <p>
          A mobile application that behaves like a personal assistant. Understands spoken English and performs basic tasks like calls, messaging, setting alarms, finding routes to name a few. The application also learns information like the home address, office address, etc of the user from their frequently visited locations (yes, it's like Siri, for the most part. But we did think about it before Siri was released. Promise.).

            Developed a new fuzzy rule-based model to assess and classify the quality of ground water into discrete categories based on the concentration of salts in the water sample.
            The data used was the concentration of a set of salts in each borewell across the state of Karnataka.
            The system also provides charts for better visualization of data.
            This project was sponsored by the government of Karnataka, India to improve water quality management in the rural areas of the state.
            This was a part of my final semester research project during my undergraduate course.

            Developed an Android application, "CityScout" as part of an international competition themed on smart mobility conducted by <a href="http://worldline.com/en-us/home.html">ATOS WorldLine</a>.
            Our app idea was selected among the top 15 in the world.
            “Cityscout” is an efficient travel planner which helps you organize your day, by giving you context-aware information like modes of transport, shopping malls, restaurants, etc according to your travel needs. We implemented this application under the guidance of senior executives from ATOS. I was closely involved in designing the business logic layer, as well as the backend database layer. This was my first experience with handling large amounts of data.
