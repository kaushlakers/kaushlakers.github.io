          This system predicts if a given Stack Overflow post will be successfully answered or not. We used the <a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">Stackoverflow data dump</a> for this task.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used text based features relating to the title, body and tags associated with the posted question to build a Multionomial Naive Bayes classifier to perform this task. The 
          <a href="https://github.com/kaushlakers/stackoverflow-success-predictor"> code</a> is available here.

          Used a supervised learning approach to devise a system that can automatically detect ironic tweets from twitter.
          I collected tweets with the “#irony” tag using the twitter stream API.
          Analysis was performed on the data to identify simple features like use of quotations, punctuations and emoticons. Techniques like sentiment analysis and antonym detection were also used to extract more complex features.

          A mobile application that behaves like a personal assistant. Understands spoken English and performs basic tasks like calls, messaging, setting alarms, finding routes to name a few. The application also learns information like the home address, office address, etc of the user from their frequently visited locations (yes, it's like Siri, for the most part. But we did think about it before Siri was released. Promise.).

            Developed an Android application, "CityScout" as part of an international competition themed on smart mobility conducted by <a href="http://worldline.com/en-us/home.html">ATOS WorldLine</a>.
            Our app idea was selected among the top 15 in the world.
            “Cityscout” is an efficient travel planner which helps you organize your day, by giving you context-aware information like modes of transport, shopping malls, restaurants, etc according to your travel needs. We implemented this application under the guidance of senior executives from ATOS. I was closely involved in designing the business logic layer, as well as the backend database layer. This was my first experience with handling large amounts of data.
