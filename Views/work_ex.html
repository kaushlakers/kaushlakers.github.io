            I was a part of the team that worked on Amazon's recently released <span style="font-weight: bold">Business Intelligence product - QuickSight </span>. Aligning myself with my interests and previous experience, I chose to work on the UX Engineering team. Working on such a large application at a company like Amazon was a great experience. I got to interact with some of the smartest front end engineers and designers on a daily basis. I was also given the task to implement on of the key features for the product - Storytelling. The feature gives the user the opportunity to capture visualizations and analysis performed and share them with others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          From a technology standpoint, I worked on some really cool front end technologies like React, Flux and Sass, as well as DynamoDB on the back end.

      <h2 style="color:#585858;">Cisco Systems </h2>
      <p> I worked at Cisco Systems as an IT Engineer for 1 year between July 2013 and July 2014 following a 4 month internship. I was part of the Cisco Commerce IT team, which was responsible for developing and maintaining the Cisco Commerce tools - Cisco Commerce Workspace and Cisco Service Contract Center.

      </p>
        <p>During this time, I got to work on a variety of projects across many areas. Some of the projects worth mentioning are as follows:


        <br/><br/>
        <h4 class="project-name">Cisco Commerce UI:</h4>
        </p>
        <p class="skill-list">

        </p>
        <p>
            Was one of the main frontend developers in a large team of around 50 people. Completely revamped the UI for the Cisco Commerce tool using the AngularJS framework.
            Personally took the initiative to implement lazy loading of modules using RequireJS.
